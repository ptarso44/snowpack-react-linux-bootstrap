# snowpack-react-linux-bootstrap
Install and Bootstrap a new Node application with Yarn, Snowpack, React, TS, Prettier and ESLint pre-made configurations through bash scripts

## P.S.:
Those scripts only work on linux. They will also work in Containers and WSL.

## Installation Instructions
1. If you dont have node, npm, npx or yarn installed, run "install_node16_npm8_yarn.sh"
2. Run "start_snowpack_app_eslint_prettier_ts.sh" to bootstrap the application.

Happy Coding :D
